(* Example of a combinator and using LC in LML. Should output 24 *)
(* Don't use the Y combinator, as it will not terminate because of the CPS translation *)
let Z = L f . (L x . f (L y . x x y)) (L x . f (L y . x x y)) in
let G = L f . L n . if n = 0 then 1 else n * (f (n - 1)) in
let factorial = Z G in
factorial 4
